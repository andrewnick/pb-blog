Although some accredit me with legend status, I am but a simple man, with a few simple pleasures. Like the joy of holding a grandson in my arms. The satisfaction of a well stacked dishwasher. The first crunch into a warm pie after cranking out a 100ks before 11am. The pride of completing a team Half Iron Man with my sons. The cool smear of butt cream on a warm summer's day.

I spend most days as the director of a Bible school in central Waikato, and previously worked for 20 years as a director of an outdoors programme. I admit, to the shame of those who love me, to being a reformed unicyclist, but am proud to claim I have been mountain biking before mountain biking was invented.

When I'm not delving into hermeneutics and exegetical methods, you'll find me planning my next epic ride. This blog contains some of these adventures and I hope you enjoy coming along for the ride.

PB.
