I didn’t get my summer bikepacking trip this year so with Covid-19 closing Capernwray and some time available an early spring trip proved too tempting. The initial plan was to leave after Lucas’ first birthday in West Auckland travelling from Pukekohe as Glenys was also going to be on a school hockey tournament there. For a while I’ve wanted to do a loop taking in Port Waikato then down the coast to Mokau coming back via Okura & Piopio.  Once again the virus put a spanner in the works with Auckland being in level 3 lockdown and all parties being postponed. Hockey was transferred to The Mount so my shuttle option was no longer available so it was back to the planning notebook. Reverse the direction of travel but leaving from home seemed to be very feasible.

The planned route was to Piopio, Okura, Mokau then back via western roads to Ngarawahia and then home covering mostly back roads with plenty of gravel and climbing. Good options for accommodation and eating and with reasonable weather predicted. Surely I could cut out the distance in less days…..

Over all distance biked: 534km with 7931 metres ascended. Recorded on Strava but I had issues with consistency and battery life on my phone so these figures are from my Garmin Dakota GPS.

Day 1:  Cambridge to Piopio via Waitomo

Distance: 106km		Ascent: 1556m

Time (moving): 5hr 20m		Moving average: 19.2km/hr

The first stage of 66km to Waitomo was on back roads but all paved and the usual rolling Waikato farmland so it was nice to hit Waitomo Valley Road as the scenery closed in and the road got quieter. I stopped in Waitomo Village for a coffee, smoothie & snack and the first of my many chats to those who wandered onto my path. The people I met on this trip complemented the scenery from a bore to engaging!  All the business people I talked to missed the Auckland traffic and spending but it is the ‘off season’ so quiet anyway, just the quiet started earlier than usual.

From Waitomo there’s a bit of climbing topping out at 480m with the first of the gravel roads on which I came across the warning sign saying “Grader next 4km”. Freshly graded gravel can be terrible to ride on so I was somewhat apprehensive for the next section, fortunately the machine I next saw was a roller, it was in fact a compacted surface that I enjoyed instead.

As one gets out of the Waikato the hills get bigger and the farm land less fertile so less dairying and more sheep & beef. From now until the last day I saw and smelt plenty of feral goats grazing road sides and farmland. I understand there is now some money in selling them. Goat curry can be very nice if not made from an old billy. The fresh westerly wind while fresh wasn’t a problem although with the last 20km being mostly downhill it did get a bit cool.

Piopio is home of the Fat Pigeon which was unfortunately closed when I got in. Accommodation for the night was camping at the Tui Camp site ($5 pp) a basic facility built by some community minded souls with school kids helping out.  Good toilets and even a hot shower if I had purchased a Kiwicash tag to pay electronically (I hadn’t). I carried my tent expecting to camp but with few people about I was able to sleep on the concrete floor of the shelter. Dinner was rice & tuna eaten with a plastic spoon I scabbed from the local superette.

There seemed to be a 2 semi-permanent residents in their motorhomes, 2 more came in for the night and one departed but not before unloading on me more dribble than I’ve heard for a while. Beneath it all he seemed a lonely soul, no wonder though as he seemed to have lost the ability to stop talking, to top it off he had a sick dog with him who took advantage of my distraction and laid on my sleeping bag & mat leaving some dampness behind.
