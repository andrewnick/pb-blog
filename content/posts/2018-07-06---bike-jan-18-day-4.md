The ride out of town took me past a roadside fruit & vege shop. Bananas are easy on the stomach and fresh peaches make any day better, so it is stock up time. My first planned stop is Eastwood Hills Arboretum 30km on. It is easy riding along the valleys as I gradually climb west from the coast. It is hot again so I park my bike pay the entry and buy a ginger beer. My energy levels are not good and I’m tiring easily so I take my time wandering the shaded paths looking at trees. Douglas Cook, the man who started this place in 1910 has left the largest collect of Northern hemisphere trees & shrubs in the Southern hemisphere. He also surprised some of the locals as he liked to garden naked. I made the second biggest mistake of this trip here. Just before I departed, a trip to a flushing toilet was in order. It was here that I inadvertently left my tub of butt cream. When one is spending a lot of time in the saddle this stuff is gold, suffice to say I was now a lot poorer.

The road continues to climb up the valley to the picturesque Rere Falls then onto the Rere slide.

I can tell this is a popular place as there is a fair amount of traffic passing me. The slide is just that, a 60m slide on papa rock in a stream. It’s swim time to cool off and relax in the shade. I get talking to a guy who is there with his family. He tells me of the road conditions I can expect further on. Hilly & gravel, he will be heading that way later in the day. Being a bike rider, he has some empathy. I note that he has a ute capable of holding a bike if he finds a broken rider later that day….. I knock back a banana with a boiled egg, brave the stinking public toilets then head away. The tar seal gives way to gravel, narrows up and climbs. Surprisingly there is some traffic and even 2 stock trucks.

Once on the tops the road widens with sweeping bends made for logging trucks which are absent this early in January. A vehicle approaches from behind and stops beside me, it is the ute, they offer any help I need but pride only allows me to take water, not the ride I secretly desire. I enjoy riding on gravel, but this soon stops and I’m soon onto the state Highway turning right back to Matawai. There is a camp ground here and apart from a camper van I had it to myself. The bunk rooms are converted containers with 8 bunks in each, fine for one person with bike, it would be pretty warm with more.

I was able to procure another 6 free range eggs for dinner and tomorrows lunch, as I started cooking them up the movanners came in. My experience with these people has generally been great. They appreciate other travellers, like a good yarn and have well stocked kitchens in their vans. This friendly couple were no exception. When they found out the reason for my raspy voice it was out with the nutribullet and ingredients for a smoothie. Despite my muted protestations I was soon sucking back a soothing blueberry smoothie. I retired to bed in a better frame of mind and stomach, the promise of good friends the next night to look forward to.
